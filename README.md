# Stress-Level-Detector
Stress Level Detector is a C programming project that analyzes daily task planning, completion, working hours, and break time to estimate stress levels. By identifying mismatches in daily activities, the system calculates a stress score and classifies stress as Low, Moderate, or High without using physical sensors.
